Changed the EC2 instance types to Standard Reserved instances with no upfront payment. 
Reduced the amount of outbound data transfered from S3. This will require application updates to limit the size/quantity of media shared on the site.
Changed the database to a single instance with extra backup storage. This will increase downtime in the event of a database outage.
